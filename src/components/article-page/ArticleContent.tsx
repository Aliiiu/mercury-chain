        <p className="text-white/80">
          IQ.wiki formerly Everipedia Theodor and Sam Kazemian originally met
          through a mutual acquaintance in 2013. But it wasn&apos;t until the
          summer of 2014, when Theodor was visiting Sam Kazemian at UCLA, that
          the two began discussing the original idea behind what would later
          become Everipedia. A few months later during the fall, the two decided
          to officially start working on the project and Theodor traveled to Los
          Angeles, California to pursue Everipedia full-time. During the spring
          of 2015, Mahbod Moghadam and Travis Moore joined as co-founders and
          together they raised a seed investment from Mucker Capital. In
          December 2017, Everipedia announced that Wikipedia Co-Founder Larry
          Sanger had joined the company as its new Chief Information Officer.
          After the announcement, Theodor was featured on the front page
          of WIRED alongside Larry Sanger and Travis Moore. In February 2018, it
          was announced that Everipedia had raised $30 million from Galaxy
          Digital. The news was covered in a vast number of prominent
          publications such as Fortune Magazine, Reuters, Business Insider, and
          a featured interview with Theodor in Swedish Business Magazine Dagens
          Industri. Since then Everipedia&apos;s vision has grown. In 2020,
          Everipedia launched OraQles, the leading first-party oracle service

        <h2 className="text-white/90 text-4xl font-semibold">Early Life</h2>
        <p className="text-white/80">
          heodor grew up in Jönköping, Sweden. When he was 11 years old he
          founded an online gaming community that hosted online servers for
          in-game franchises such as Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Minecraft.
          The community eventually grew into a social networking service
          specifically tailored to gamers. Theodor dropped out of high school to
          pursue the social networking idea but ended up being offered an
          internship at a Swedish IT company where he began working at the age
          of 16. Less than a year later, Theodor landed a full-time position at
          the same company where he continued working until 2014.
